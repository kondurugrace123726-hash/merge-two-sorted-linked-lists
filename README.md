# merge-two-sorted-linked-lists

Merge two sorted linked lists using both recursive and iterative approaches. Demonstrates linked list manipulation, recursion, and space-optimized iterative merging.

Approach 1: Recursive
Approach 2: Iterative

Time Complexity: O(n + m)
Space Complexity:
   Recursive: O(n + m)
   Iterative: O(1)
